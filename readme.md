# XMLRPC Ratelimit Test
A Handy tool for checking if a host is limiting the request rate to a site's XMLRPC file

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.x+ (no dependencies, standard library)

**Instructions:**
1) `git clone https://github.com/rfaile313/XMLRPC-Ratelimit-Test.git`
2) `cd XMLRPC-Ratelimit-Test`
3) `python3 ratelimit.py`

Since Python 2.x ships with most systems, it's a good idea to specify the version.
